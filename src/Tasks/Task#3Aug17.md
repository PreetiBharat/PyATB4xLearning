# 1. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
  This is = Assignment operator. This = operator is used to assign the values to variable.
  For ex:x = 5. Value 5 is assigned to the variable x.
  This is a == Comparator operator. is used to comparing if two values are equal.
  Ex: if x == 5 checks if x is equal to 5 and return True or false.

# 2. What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
  This ** operator is called power or exponentiation in Python.
  Ex: 2 ** 3 is 8 (2 raise to the power of 3).

# 3. What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
  The ^ operator in python performs a XOR operation on the operands.
  It compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand.
  If both bits are different, the resulting bit is set to 1,
  otherwise it is set to 0.
  The ^ operator is commonly used in contexts like: Cryptography: For encrypting and decrypting data
  using XOR operations Bit manipulation:
  For performing operations on individual bits of a number Checking for unique elements in a list or set
